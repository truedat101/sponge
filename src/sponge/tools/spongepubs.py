r"""The idea behind Project Sponge is to provide some tools to measure an OSS projectâ€™s
vitality. The concept I will use is similar to an APGAR test when a baby is born. An
APGAR test checks the vitals several times after the birth (at birth, and then
throughout the next hour or two of life). For an OSS project, you should be checking
what I will call the Project Vitality: The vital stats and data showing how well an OSS
project is doing at a given point in time. Since Project Vitality can be a relative measure,
it is important to be able to compare the Project Vitality to past measurements. The Vitality
Dashboard is the visual report of Project Vitality over time. This is targeted at OSS project
leads, and specifically, to help commercial open source types to justify the open source approach
to management by promises to track progress using some reasonable metrics for success and signs
of life. Ideally, sponge can evolve into a sort of OSS Project Analytics tool.

python spongepubs.py -c [config file path]
    spongepubs reads in the config file and first generates a Sponger.soak() request to pull
    from various analytics sources.  It then generates a Sponger.squeeze() request to extract
    the analytics data and push it into the default publisher.  This is currently the only
    supported mode of execution.
examples:

    * python ScanReport.py ../../../../examples/spongesite.conf
