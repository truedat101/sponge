NAME
  spongex

DESCRIPTION

	The idea behind Project Sponge is to provide some tools to measure an OSS project’s
	vitality. The concept I will use is similar to an APGAR test when a baby is born. A
	n APGAR test checks the vitals several times after the birth (at birth, and then throughout
	the next hour or two of life). For an OSS project, you should be checking what I will call
	the Project Vitality: The vital stats and data showing how well an OSS project is doing at
	a given point in time. Since Project Vitality can be a relative measure, it is important to
	be able to compare the Project Vitality to past measurements. The Vitality Dashboard is the
	visual report of Project Vitality over time. This is targeted at OSS project leads, and
	specifically, to help commercial open source types to justify the open source approach to
	management by promises to track progress using some reasonable metrics for success and signs
	of life. Ideally, sponge can evolve into a sort of OSS Project Analytics tool.
